            On a turn, a player rolls the die 🎲 repeatedly. The goal is to
            accumulate as many points as possible, adding up (hold) the numbers
            rolled on the die 🎲. However, if a player rolls a <span>1</span>,
            the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated
            during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a <span>1</span> doesn't
            wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total
            earned during that particular roll. A player has to choose to hold
            (stop rolling the die 🎲) if they do not want to take a chance of
            rolling a
            <span>1</span>
            and losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses
            to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his
            or her score. When a player reaches a total of
            <span>Target🎯</span> points, the game ends and that player is the
            winner 🏆.
